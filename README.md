## About

The **3D Portfolio** is an interactive and visually dynamic website designed to highlight my skills in web development, 3D modeling, and animation. The site integrates **React-Three-Fiber** for 3D rendering and **Framer Motion** for smooth animations, making it an engaging experience for users. It is built using **Next.js** for server-side rendering and optimized performance.

The portfolio features a combination of stunning 3D visuals and modern UI/UX design. Visitors can interact with different 3D scenes, view projects, and get in touch with me via an integrated contact form.
